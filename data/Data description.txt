Monthly average data were downloaded; most variables originate as a <daily average> value for a given month. These daily values were converted to <monthly totals> by multiplying the orginal daily value by the number of days in each month (note that leap years were neglected).

data are stored as a Matlab .mat file.

data cover the period Jan 1, 1958 through December 31, 2007. 50 full years.

Variable definitions:

months        --> Month count for entire dataset (i.e., 1 to 50*12)
years         --> Fractional years from 1958 through end of 2007

ME_Monthly    --> Meltwater Production, monthly total of daily averages mmWE
RF_Monthly    --> Rainfall, monthly total of daily averages mmWE
RZ_Monthly    --> Refreezing, monthly total of daily averages mmWE
RU_Monthly    --> Runoff, monthly total of daily averages mmWE

SF_Monthly    --> Snowfall, monthly total of daily averages mmWE
RO1_Monthly   --> Snow density, monthly average of top layer kg/m^3

ST_Monthly    --> Surface temperature, mean of the month deg C
TT_9_Monthly  --> Temperature, mean of the month* deg C
Temp10m       --> Average monthly temperature of firn at 10 m depth. These  
                  values look very weird! deg C

* no one knows the difference between <surface temperature> and temperature. The temperature is typically 1-2 deg warmer
than surface temp. The surface temp 'could be' the temp of the snow surface, and temperature could be the 2m air temp.
